🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset, focusing on data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical analysis, and visualization using Python.

🔍 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze passenger data to identify key factors influencing survival outcomes. The analysis follows a structured data analytics workflow, from raw data to actionable insights.

📊 Key Tasks Performed

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover survival patterns
- Feature engineering: created Family_count from SibSp and Parch
-Group-by and statistical analysis based on:
Gender,
Passenger Class,
Age,
Fare.
- Data visualization for insight communication

📈 Key Insights

- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males
- First-class passengers showed better survival chances
- Age and fare revealed meaningful survival patterns
- Family size had a noticeable impact on survival probability

🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
